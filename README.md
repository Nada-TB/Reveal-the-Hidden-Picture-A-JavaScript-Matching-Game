# Reveal the Hidden Picture: A JavaScript Matching Game

"Reveal the Hidden Picture: A JavaScript Matching Game" is a web-based game where players aim to uncover a hidden image by interacting with a grid of twelve squares. Each time a player clicks on two different squares, random images are displayed. If the images match, a part of the hidden picture corresponding to the location of the matched squares is revealed, and the player's score is updated. The game continues until only two squares remain; if these two squares are identical, the player wins; otherwise, they lose. This project demonstrates proficiency in JavaScript, focusing on code organization, interactive design, and dynamic content management.

## Introduction

Developed "Reveal the Hidden Picture: A JavaScript Matching Game," a web-based memory game designed to challenge and entertain players by unveiling a hidden image. The game involves a 3x4 grid of squares, each concealing a part of an image behind random pictures. Players click on squares to reveal the images and match pairs, which progressively uncovers segments of the hidden picture. Key features include real-time scoring, interactive gameplay, and dynamic content loading. This project showcases skills in JavaScript for creating engaging, interactive web applications, with a focus on modular code, DOM manipulation, and user interface design.
